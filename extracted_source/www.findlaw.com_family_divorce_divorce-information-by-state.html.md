DIVORCE INFORMATION BY STATE
Divorce Information by State
By Amy Vandervort-Clark, J.D. | Legally reviewed by Melissa Bender, Esq. | Last reviewed September 18, 2024
 Legally Reviewed 
 Fact-Checked 

Each state and territory sets its own divorce laws, so the laws and procedures that govern the divorce process will vary.  Understanding the divorce process in your state will help you prepare.

Each court will have its own rules for the divorce petition and filing fees. There are different residency requirements and waiting periods in each state.

When it comes to a possible divorce, the last thing you want to do is to go into the process unprepared. You will have many questions, such as:

How do I get a court order for child support and child custody?
Can I get spousal support or alimony?
What is marital property?
Does my state have no-fault divorce?
What if we have an uncontested divorce or a contested divorce case?

Knowing the divorce laws in your state can help you answer these questions.
